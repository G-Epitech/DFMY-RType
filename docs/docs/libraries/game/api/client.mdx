# Client API

This API will give you all the tools you need to interact with server.\
The first thing you need to do is to Create a new instance of the client with the basics informations:
- The server address
- The server port

Next, you need to connect to the server with the `Register` method.

```cpp
auto client = new api::Client("127.0.0.1", 5000);

payload::Connection connectPayload = {
  .pseudo = "TekMath"
};

bool success = client->Register(connectPayload);
if (!success)
  throw std::runtime_error("Failed to connect to the server.");
```

The API handle the TCP initialisation, the connection to the server and the confirmations between us.\
Thanks [Abra](/docs/libraries/abra) for the help on the API ðŸ˜‰.

Next, when you have get the lobby ID (the method to list lobby is not implemented yet), you can join a lobby with the following code:

```cpp
payload::JoinLobby joinPayload = {
  .lobbyId = 1
};

auto success = client->JoinLobby(joinPayload);
if (!success)
  throw std::runtime_error("Failed to join the lobby.");
```

The API will get the lobby UDP infos, connect to the UDP and reply to the server with client UDP infos.

Now, you can send and receive messages from the server.

:::note
The first `Register` method have a timeout of 5 seconds.\
The `JoinLobby` method have a timeout of 10 seconds.

:::info
If you want to be sure that you are connected to the server (TCP only), you can use the method `IsConnected`.
