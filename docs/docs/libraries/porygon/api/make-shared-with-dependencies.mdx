# `MakeSharedWithDependencies`

Make a new shared pointer of a class and provide it the dependencies handler as first constructor parameter if needed.

:::success Tip
This method acts like [`MakeWithDependencies`](make-with-dependencies) but returns a shared pointer instead of a plain instance.
:::

```cpp
template <typename T, typename... Args>
std::shared_ptr<T> MakeSharedWithDependencies(Args&&... args);
```
This method takes a template parameter `T` which is the class to instantiate.

## Parameters
- `T`: The class to instantiate.
- `args`: The arguments to pass to the class constructor.

## Return value
- A shared pointer to the instance of the class `T`.

## Notes
:::info
If you want to get access to the current `DependenciesHandler` instance in the constructor of the service, you can pass a `DependenciesHandler::Ptr` as the first argument of the constructor.
:::

## Examples
Refer to the [`MakeWithDependencies` example section](make-with-dependencies#Examples) for an example of how to use this method.
