# Packet builder

The packet builder is an easy developer friendly tools to build packets for the network SDK.\
Here is a documentation on how to use the packet builder.

## Get started
You can create one packet builder instance in your project and use it multiple times to build packets.\
Here is a simple example on how to create a packet with the packet builder.

```cpp title="main.cpp"
int main() {
    // Create a packet builder instance
    PacketBuilder packetBuilder;
    unsigned int helloMessageType = 1;
    char[13] helloMessage = "Hello World!";

    // Create a packet
    Packet<char[13]> packet = packetBuilder
        .SetPayloadType(PayloadType::kCustom)
        .SetMessageType(helloMessageType)
        .Build<char[13]>(helloMessage);

    return 0;
}
```

:::note
In the example we specified the payload type as `kCustom` but it's a default value so you can skip it.
:::

## Builder steps methods

### SetPayloadType
Set the payload type of the packet.\
Be sure to respect the maximum size of the payload type. (An exception will be thrown if the payload type is too big)

```cpp
PacketBuilder &SetPayloadType(PayloadType payloadType);
```
```cpp title="main.cpp"
PacketBuilder packetBuilder;
packetBuilder.SetPayloadType(PayloadType::kCustom);
```

### SetTurn
Set the turn of the packet.\
You must handle at your own a potential system of loop to avoid too big turn number.\
The builder will handle header flags for you.

```cpp
PacketBuilder &SetTurn(std::uint16_t turn);
```
```cpp title="main.cpp"
PacketBuilder packetBuilder;
packetBuilder.SetTurn(1);
```

### SetMessageType
Set the message type of the packet.\
It's technically a mandatory field when you construct your packet. (The default value is 0 but it's a good practice to set it).

```cpp
PacketBuilder &SetMessageType(std::uint8_t messageType);
```
```cpp title="main.cpp"
PacketBuilder packetBuilder;
packetBuilder.SetMessageType(1);
```

## Builder build method

### Build a packet
Build a packet with the specified payload.\
You must specify the type of the payload you want to build in the template.\
Your payload type size must respect the maximum size of the payload lenght. (An exception will be thrown if the payload type is too big)

```cpp
template<typename T>
Packet<T> Build(T payload);
```
```cpp title="main.cpp"
PacketBuilder packetBuilder;

Packet<std::uint8_t> packet = packetBuilder
        .SetPayloadType(PayloadType::kUint8)
        .SetMessageType(0)
        .Build<std::uint8_t>(100);
```

:::info
The message ID is automatically incremented by the builder for each packet you build.\
If you want a special ID incrementation for each user, you must for the moment have a packet builder instance for each user.
:::

### Build multiples packets
The packet builder provide you a way to build multiples packets at once.\
You must use the same build method but with a `std::vector` of payloads.

```cpp
  template<typename T>
  std::vector<Packet<T>> Build(std::vector<T> payloads);
```
```cpp title="main.cpp"
PacketBuilder packetBuilder;

std::vector<std::uint8_t> payloads = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::vector<Packet<std::uint8_t>> packets = packetBuilder
        .SetPayloadType(PayloadType::kUint8)
        .SetMessageType(0)
        .Build<std::uint8_t>(payloads);
```

Please, respect the maximum size of a multi packet build. You can refer to the maximum size of an offset.\
The offset system will be automatically handled by the builder.\
The message ID will be the same for all packets in the vector (As specified in the protocol).

:::warning
A vector must have at least one element.\
All the packets in the vector must have the same payload type.
