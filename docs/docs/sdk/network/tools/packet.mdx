# Packet

A packet is a class used by the API to represent a message sent or received by the server.\
The good practice to create a packet is to use the **[PacketBuilder](packet-builder)** class.

The class can be used to send a packet to a client or a server (the class will be exploited by the API) or when you receive a new packet.

## Packet Header Props

Here is how the packet header is structured:
```cpp title="tools/packet/header.hpp"
struct PacketHeaderProps {
    unsigned payloadLength: kPacketHeaderPayloadLengthSize = 0; // 0..1023  (10 bits)
    unsigned payloadType: kPacketHeaderPayloadTypeSize = 0;     // 0..15    (4 bits)
    unsigned offsetFlag: kPacketHeaderFlagSize = 0;             // 0..1     (1 bit)
    unsigned turnFlag: kPacketHeaderFlagSize = 0;               // 0..1     (1 bit)
};
```
The header is mainly used by the API to determine the packet type and the payload length.
You can use it by calling the `GetHeaderProps` method from the packet class.

:::warning
If you manually create a packet, you must set the header properties correctly.
All the properties are documented with Bit Fields
:::

The constants values are defined in `header.hpp` but you can also find documentation about bits allocation in **[Network Protocol - Header](/docs/network/protocol#header)**.
