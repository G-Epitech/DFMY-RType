# Vcpkg Setup

How to setup vcpkg for a seamless development experience.

## Introduction

**vcpkg** is a cross-platform package manager for C++ libraries. It simplifies the process of acquiring, managing, and integrating open-source libraries into your projects. Whether you are building a project for Windows, Linux, or macOS, vcpkg provides a unified way to install dependencies and ensure compatibility across multiple platforms.

## Setup

After you finished installing vcpkg (checkout the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd) for more information)
you will have the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable set to the path where vcpkg is installed. If not go and re-read the official documentation.

With that you can easily run the Makefile at the root of the repository to build the project.

## Manifest

Vcpkg has what we call a manifest file, which is a file that lists all the dependencies that your project needs.
This file is called `vcpkg.json` and is located at the root of the repository.

This will let us include dependencies in the project without having to manually install them via the `vcpkg cli`.

It will automatically install the dependencies when you build the project.

## CMake and Vcpkg

To use vcpkg with CMake, you need to set the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable to the path of the vcpkg toolchain file.
This file is located at `$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

To automate the process of setting the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable, you can use **[CMake presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html)**.

## CLion and Vcpkg

At G-Epitech we are huge fans of Jetbrains products, so here is a little tip on how to use vcpkg with CLion.

First, you need to set the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable in the CMake options.

Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake` and add the following line to the `CMake options` field:

```bash
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

Another thing you can do is go to `View > Tool Windows > Vcpkg` and you will have a nice UI to manage your dependencies.
