# Build

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed before proceeding with the build process:

- **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)** (version `3.27` or later)
- **[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)** (for dependency management)
- **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)** (required for Windows users)
- **g++** (required for Linux users)

These prerequisites are essential across all platforms to successfully build the project.

:::tip
You can check out our **[vcpkg setup](./vcpkg.mdx)** guide for a very easy integration.

## Building the Project

### 1. Clone the Project Repository
Begin by cloning the project repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:G-Epitech/DFMY-RType.git
cd DFMY-RType
```

### 2. Set Up vcpkg
Install vcpkg by following the [official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd), then integrate it with CMake. Run the following command:
```bash
./vcpkg integrate install
```

If you're on Windows, replace `./vcpkg` with `.\vcpkg` for the appropriate path format.

### 3. Configure and Install Dependencies with CMake

Since we are using a **vcpkg manifest**, the dependencies defined in `vcpkg.json` will be automatically installed when you configure the project with CMake.

Use the following command to configure the project and ensure vcpkg is linked correctly:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg_root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

- The `-S .` argument specifies the source directory as the current folder.
- The `-B` build argument sets the build directory to `build/`.
- `<vcpkg_root>` should be replaced with the actual path to your vcpkg installation.

This command will configure the project and install all required dependencies from `vcpkg.json`.

### 4. Build the Project

After configuring CMake, you can build the project by running:
```bash
cmake --build build
```

This will compile the client, server, and libraries defined in the subdirectories.

### 5. Run the Project

After building, you can run the client or server binaries from the `build` directory:
```bash
./build/r-type_client    # To run the client
./build/r-type_server    # To run the server
```

## Additional Notes
- For **Windows users**, ensure that `Visual Studio` is installed and the appropriate `MSVC` compiler is selected.
- For **Linux users**, make sure `g++` is installed and available in your `PATH`.

For ease of use we also added a `Makefile` at the root of the repository, you can also check it out
