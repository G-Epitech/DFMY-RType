# Scripting Context

The `ScriptingContext` structure encapsulates the necessary information required for executing scripts in the Zygarde engine. It provides access to the gameâ€™s registry, timing data, and the entity context, enabling scripts to interact with the game world effectively.

## Overview

The `ScriptingContext` is designed to be passed to scripts during their execution, allowing them to access important state information. This includes references to the registry for entity manipulation, delta time for frame-rate-independent calculations, and the entity itself.

## Key Concepts

| **Concept**            | **Description**                                                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Registry Reference** | A pointer to the game registry, enabling access to all entities and components in the game.   |
| **Delta Time**         | The time elapsed since the last frame, used for smooth animations and physics calculations.   |
| **Entity Reference**   | The specific entity that the script is operating on, allowing for entity-specific behavior.   |
| **Archetype Manager**  | A reference to the archetype manager, facilitating efficient entity and component management. |

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "context.hpp"

void exampleFunction(const zygarde::scripting::types::ScriptingContext::Ptr& context) {
    // Access the registry
    auto entity = context->me;
    auto deltaTime = context->deltaTime;

    // Perform actions based on the scripting context
}
```
