# Position

The `Position` component is part of the `zygarde::core::components` namespace and represents the spatial location and alignment of a 3D object within the system. It consists of a 3D point vector and an `Alignment` struct to handle horizontal and vertical alignment.

## Overview

The `Position` component allows for the specification of both a 3D position and customizable alignment options (horizontal and vertical), useful for positioning objects within a scene or UI.

```cpp
namespace zygarde::core::components {

struct Position {
  core::types::Vector3f point;  ///< Position point
  Alignment aligns;             ///< Aligns
};

}  // namespace zygarde::core::components
