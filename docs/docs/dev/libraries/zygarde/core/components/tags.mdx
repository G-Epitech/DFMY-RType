# Tags


The `Tags` component in the `zygarde::core::components` namespace is a utility for managing sets of tags, implemented as a wrapper around a `std::set` of strings. This class provides methods for adding, removing, and querying tags, making it ideal for tagging systems within the `zygarde` library.
