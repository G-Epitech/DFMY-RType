# Rigidbody2D

The `Rigidbody2D` class, part of the `zygarde::physics::components` namespace, represents a 2D rigid body in a physics engine.
This component is used to apply forces, set velocities, and control properties such as drag and kinematic states.

## Overview

`Rigidbody2D` is a final class that handles basic physical properties for 2D objects, including movement, forces, drag, and kinematic settings.
It is commonly used for dynamic objects affected by physical forces.

## Properties

- ``velocity``: A ``Vector2f`` representing the initial velocity.
- ``isKinematic``: A boolean indicating whether the rigid body is kinematic (i.e., not affected by forces or collisions).
- ``drag``: A float representing the drag value applied to the object.

The `Rigidbody2D` will contain the simulated movement offset after the movement system. But the movement offset will only be applied to the position after the `Position System`.
We first need to check it with the collision system to see the real movement.

## Example Usage
```cpp
using namespace zygarde::physics::components;

core::types::Vector2f initialVelocity(10.0f, 5.0f);
Rigidbody2D rigidbody(initialVelocity, false, 0.8f);

// Apply a force
rigidbody.AddForce(3.0f, 2.0f);

// Set a new velocity
rigidbody.SetVelocity(core::types::Vector2f(15.0f, 7.5f));

// Cancel velocity
rigidbody.CancelVelocity();

// Check kinematic state
if (rigidbody.IsKinematic()) {
    // Do something specific for kinematic bodies
}
```
