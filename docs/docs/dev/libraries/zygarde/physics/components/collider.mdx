# Collider2D

The `Collider2D` class, part of the `zygarde::physics::components` namespace, represents the core 2D collision detection mechanism.
It is used by other components, such as `BoxCollider2D`, to manage collision layers and handle collision events.

## Overview

`Collider2D` is a final class designed to handle low-level collision detection and management within a physics engine.
It maintains a queue of detected collisions and uses layer-based filtering to determine which objects interact.

## Properties

- ``include_layers``: A vector of integers specifying the layers the collider should include in its checks.
- ``collision_layers``: A vector of integers specifying the collision layers the collider should respond to.
- ``collision_queue``: Queue of collisions the collider has.

## Example Usage
The ``Collider2D`` class is a private utility within ``BoxCollider2D``, meaning it is not intended for direct use outside of its friend class.
Below is an example of how ``BoxCollider2D`` interacts with ``Collider2D`` to process collisions.

```cpp
#include "box_collider_2_d.hpp"

using namespace zygarde::physics::components;

BoxCollider2D boxCollider(Vector2f(100.0f, 50.0f), {1, 2}, {1});

// Check for collisions in BoxCollider2D, which uses Collider2D internally
if (boxCollider.HasCollision()) {
    auto collision = boxCollider.GetNextCollision();
    // Process collision details
}
```
