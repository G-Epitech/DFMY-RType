# CollisionSystem

The `CollisionSystem` class in the `zygarde::physics::systems` namespace is a core part of the 2D physics engine. This system manages collision detection and resolution for entities that have the `Rigidbody2D`, `Position`, and `BoxCollider2D` components, ensuring that objects interact according to physical constraints.

## Overview

`CollisionSystem` is responsible for identifying and managing collisions between entities by running a series of checks and resolving collisions. This process is essential for creating realistic physics-based interactions in 2D space. It integrates with components such as:

- `Rigidbody2D`: Represents the physical body and movement properties of an entity.
- `Position`: Manages the entityâ€™s position in the world.
- `BoxCollider2D`: Defines the collider, or bounding area, for detecting collisions.

The `CollisionSystem` uses these components to:

- Detect overlapping bounding boxes between entities.
- Check if entities are on compatible collision layers.
- Resolve collisions by adjusting positions and adding collision events to colliders.

## Key Concepts

The CollisionSystem employs several key techniques and principles:

| **Concept**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Layer-Based Filtering** | Entities are assigned collision and include layers, which determine which objects they can interact with. This provides control over what types of entities can collide with each other. |
| **Bounding Box Overlap**  | The `BoxCollider2D` component defines a rectangular area around an entity for collision detection. When bounding boxes overlap, it signals a potential collision.                        |
| **Movement Offset**       | The `Rigidbody2D`'s movement offset allows `CollisionSystem` to simulate an entity's next position in advance, enabling predictive collision checks before movement occurs.              |
| **Collision Resolution**  | Once a collision is detected, the system either stops movement or queues the collision within the collider, allowing other systems to handle it appropriately.                           |

## Core Functionality

The main method in CollisionSystem, Run, iterates over all entities with the required components and checks each entity for potential collisions with others.
If a collision is detected, it is resolved according to layer compatibility and kinematic status.
```cpp
void Run(std::shared_ptr<Registry> r,
         zipper<components::Rigidbody2D, core::components::Position, components::BoxCollider2D> components) override;
```

## Collision Detection Process

The CollisionSystem performs a few key steps in each run:

1. **Layer Matching**: Using HasMatchingCollisionLayers, it checks if two colliders are compatible based on their collision layers.
2. **Simulated Position Calculation**: Calculates the projected position of each entity using GetSimulatedPosition, which adds the movement offset to the current position.
3. **Bounding Box Overlap Check**: Creates bounding boxes for both entities and checks for overlap using CheckBoundingBoxOverlap.
4. **Collision Handling**: If a collision is detected, it is either resolved immediately or stored for later processing, depending on whether the colliding entities are kinematic.

## Bounding Box Overlap

Bounding boxes are created based on the entities' size (from ``BoxCollider2D``) and projected position (calculated with ``GetSimulatedPosition``).
The ``CheckBoundingBoxOverlap`` method compares each side of the bounding boxes to determine if they overlap on both x and y axes.
