# Zipper

The `zipper` class is a utility that encapsulates the functionality of `zipper_iterator`, providing an easy interface for iterating over multiple containers in a synchronized manner. By utilizing the `zipper`, developers can efficiently access and process related data stored in separate container types, making it especially useful in entity-component systems (ECS).

## Overview

The `zipper` class is designed to work with sparse arrays, allowing for the combination of various containers into a single iterable structure. This allows for parallel processing of components from different types, enhancing the performance and readability of systems that operate on multiple attributes of entities.

## Key Concepts

| **Concept**                   | **Description**                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Container Aggregation**     | Combines multiple sparse arrays into a single iterable object, facilitating the handling of related data sets.      |
| **Dynamic Iteration**         | Provides dynamic begin and end functions, allowing the zipper to adapt to changes in the underlying data structure. |
| **Integration with Iterator** | Leverages `zipper_iterator` to manage simultaneous iteration over the contained sparse arrays.                      |

## Core Functionality

### 1. Constructor

The `zipper` constructor initializes the zipper with a variadic number of sparse arrays, setting up the underlying data structures for iteration.

```cpp
explicit zipper(sparse_array<Containers>::ptr &&...cs);
```

### 2. Begin Iterator

The `begin` method returns an iterator pointing to the start of the zipped containers, allowing the user to begin iterating over the elements.

```cpp
iterator begin();
```

### 3. End Iterator

The `end` method returns an iterator representing the end of the zipped containers. This is crucial for managing the iteration boundary.

```cpp
iterator end();
```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating how to use the `zipper` class to iterate over different component types in an ECS architecture.

```cpp
#include "zipper.hpp"

sparse_array<Position> positions = {...};
sparse_array<Velocity> velocities = {...};

zygarde::tools::zipper<Position, Velocity> zipped(positions, velocities);

for (auto it = zipped.begin(); it != zipped.end(); ++it) {
auto [position, velocity] = *it; // Retrieve position and velocity
// Process the components together
}
```

## Conclusion

The `zipper` class serves as a powerful abstraction for handling multiple sparse arrays in a unified manner, allowing for synchronized iteration over different component types. By leveraging this class, developers can create more efficient and maintainable ECS systems within the Zygarde engine framework.
