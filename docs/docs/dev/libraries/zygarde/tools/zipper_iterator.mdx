# Zipper Iterator

The `zipper_iterator` is a powerful utility class designed to iterate over multiple containers simultaneously. It provides a way to "zip" together various collections, allowing developers to process corresponding elements from each container in lockstep. This is particularly useful in ECS architectures, where different components of an entity are often stored in separate containers.

## Overview

The `zipper_iterator` class is templated to accept an arbitrary number of container types. By using this iterator, you can efficiently access elements from multiple containers at the same index, ensuring that operations can be performed on related data simultaneously. This iterator is especially useful when dealing with systems that need to process entities with multiple components, like position and velocity in a physics simulation.

## Key Concepts

| **Concept**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simultaneous Iteration**   | Allows iteration over multiple containers in parallel, synchronizing the traversal across different data structures.                  |
| **Tuple-Based Value**        | Returns a tuple containing values from all the containers at the current index, making it easy to access multiple related components. |
| **Flexible Container Types** | Supports any number of container types, providing great flexibility for different component collections.                              |
| **End Detection**            | Automatically checks when any iterator reaches the end of its respective container, preventing out-of-bounds access.                  |

## Core Functionality

### 1. Constructor

The `zipper_iterator` constructor initializes the iterator with a tuple of iterators from the provided containers and sets the maximum number of elements to iterate over.

```cpp
zipper_iterator(iterator_tuple const &it_tuple, iterator_tuple const &end_tuple, std::size_t max);
```

### 2. Incrementing the Iterator

The iterator can be incremented using both pre-increment and post-increment operators. This functionality allows the user to advance the iterator through the zipped containers.

```cpp
zipper_iterator &operator++(); // Pre-increment
zipper_iterator operator++(int); // Post-increment
```

### 3. Dereferencing

Dereferencing the iterator returns a tuple containing the values of the elements at the current index from each container.

```cpp
value_type operator*();
```

### 4. Indexing

The iterator can also return a structure containing the index along with the value, allowing easy access to the current position in the iteration.

```cpp
value_type_with_index operator~();
```

### 5. Equality and Inequality Operators

The class defines custom equality and inequality operators to facilitate easy comparison of two `zipper_iterator` instances. This checks if either iterator has reached the end or if they are pointing to the same current index.

```cpp
friend bool operator==(zipper_iterator const &lhs, zipper_iterator const &rhs);
friend bool operator!=(zipper_iterator const &lhs, zipper_iterator const &rhs);
```

### 6. Utility Functions

The iterator includes several private utility functions, such as:

- **`incr_all`**: Increments all contained iterators simultaneously.
- **`all_set`**: Checks if all iterators are valid and not at their end.
- **`to_value`**: Converts the current iterators to a value tuple.
- **`any_end_reached`**: Checks if any of the iterators have reached the end of their respective containers.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use `zipper_iterator` to process components of an entity in an ECS setup:

```cpp
#include "zipper_iterator.hpp"
#include <vector>

std::vector<Position> positions = {...};
std::vector<Velocity> velocities = {...};

zygarde::tools::zipper_iterator<decltype(positions), decltype(velocities)> it(positions.begin(), velocities.begin(), positions.size());

while (it != end) {
auto [position, velocity] = *it; // Retrieve position and velocity
// Process position and velocity
++it; // Move to the next element
}
```

## Conclusion

The `zipper_iterator` provides a convenient and efficient way to iterate over multiple containers in an ECS framework. By allowing simultaneous access to related components, it simplifies the processing of entities, making it a valuable addition to the Zygarde engine's toolkit.
