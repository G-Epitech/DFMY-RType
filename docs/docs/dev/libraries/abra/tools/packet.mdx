# Packet

A packet is a class used by the API to represent a message sent or received by the server.\
The good practice to create a packet is to use the **[PacketBuilder](packet-builder)** class.

The class can be used to send a packet to a client or a server (the class will be exploited by the API) or when you receive a new packet.

## Packet Header Props

Here is how the packet header is structured:
```cpp title="tools/packet/props/header.hpp"
struct PacketHeaderProps {
    unsigned payloadLength: kPacketHeaderPayloadLengthSize = 0; // 0..1023  (10 bits)
    unsigned payloadType: kPacketHeaderPayloadTypeSize = 0;     // 0..15    (4 bits)
    unsigned offsetFlag: kPacketHeaderFlagSize = 0;             // 0..1     (1 bit)
    unsigned turnFlag: kPacketHeaderFlagSize = 0;               // 0..1     (1 bit)
};
```
The header is mainly used by the API to determine the packet type and the payload length.\
You can use it by calling the `GetHeaderProps` method from the packet class.

:::warning
If you manually create a packet, you must set the header properties correctly.
All the properties are documented with Bit Fields
:::

The constants values are defined in `header.hpp` but you can also find documentation about bits allocation in **[Network Protocol - Header](/docs/dev/networking/network-protocol#header)**.


## Packet Message Props

Here is how message props are structured:
```cpp title="tools/packet/props/message.hpp"
struct PacketMessageProps {
    unsigned messageId: kPacketMessageIdSize = 0;     // 0..1048575 (20 bits)
    unsigned messageType: kPacketMessageTypeSize = 0; // 0..63      (6 bits)
    unsigned : 6;
};
```

The last 6 bits are used for padding and are not used by the API.\
The message props are not used by the API and are mainly used by the client/server to determine the message type and the message id.\
You can use it by calling the `GetMessageProps` method from the packet class.

## Packet Offset Props

Here is how offset props are structured:
```cpp title="tools/packet/props/offset.hpp"
struct PacketOffsetProps {
    unsigned offset: kPacketOffsetSize = 0;         // 0..32767 (15 bits)
    unsigned offsetFlag: kPacketOffsetFlagSize = 0; // 0..1 (1 bit)
};
```

This structure is optional and is used to determine the offset of the packet.\
This part is used by the API for **Multi Packets**.

:::info
If you try to get offset props from a packet that does not have an offset (offset flag to 0 in the header), the API will throw an exception.\
You can use `packetInstance.OffsetIsEnabled()` to check if the packet has an offset.
:::

## Packet Turn Props

Here is how turn props are structured:
```cpp title="tools/packet/props/turn.hpp"
struct PacketTurnProps {
    unsigned turn: kPacketTurnSize = 0; // 0..65535 (16 bits)
};
```

This structure is optional and is used to determine the turn of the packet.\
It's not used by the API and is mainly used by the client/server to determine the turn of the packet in case of multi stats payload for example.

:::info
If you try to get turn props from a packet that does not have a turn (turn flag to 0 in the header), the API will throw an exception.\
You can use `packetInstance.TurnIsEnabled()` to check if the packet has an turn.
:::

## Packet Payload

The packet payload is defined by a typename template.\
The payload is the data that the packet contains. It can be a part of a list in case of **Multi Packets** usage.
